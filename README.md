# Data Tools for ArcGIS 10.3
Handy tools for data manipulation in ArcGIS Pro, written in Python 2.7.

For exporting to XLSX you have to install pandas 0.13.1 (compatible with preinstalled Numpy 1.7.1) and openpyxl compatibile with Pandas (version >=1.6.1 and <2.0.0). And for both of them you have to install pip and C++ compiler for Python.

> Download and install [Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7](http://aka.ms/vcpython27)
> Download file [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) and run it: `C:\Python27\ArcGIS10.3> .\python.exe PATH\TO\get-pip.py`
> Install Pandas by running `C:\Python27\ArcGIS10.3> .\python.exe -m pip install pandas==0.13.1`
> Install OpenPyXL by running `C:\Python27\ArcGIS10.3> .\python.exe -m pip install openpyxl==1.8.6`
